        -- Scrap Rat -- \n
        In this game you play as an entrepreneurial rat who really likes money.
        Your goal is to get the highest net worth that you can. You achieve this in the typical way,
        by selling products! Though being a rat, you only have one option.
        You have to sell trash to literally anyone who will buy it.
        You get trash by finding it or buying it from other rats.
        How much money can a little rat get?


        \n\n-- How to Play --\n
        Your hoard shows the number of items you own.
        Net worth shows how much money you own.
        The top 3 buttons shows trash that you can buy.
        Bellow that are 3 buttons that show trash which you can sell.
        Note that not all transactions are worth it. Be discerning which offers you take.
        Every so often you can press the salvage button to gain 1 free piece of trash.
